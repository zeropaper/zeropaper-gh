Recently, I have been asked to complete some. Coding challenges for developer positions. They wanted to test my coding skills. And these coding challenge simply sucked. And I thought about what could be better than these challenged that the gave me. And thought okay. It should be. 

A small. Challenge. Doable within one hour top. And. The. 

The results should. 

Demonstrate the the logic and coding skill of the challenged person. It should demonstrate. 

The understanding of dumb or logic and. 

Instead of just algorithm. 

So the wack-a-mole game felt to me, like an ideal. 

Candidate because it can be done very simply. And like without any styling or also the styling might be actually a second iteration of the challenge. I. Can record it like screen recording. And. 

It requires some kind of logic a bit of understanding of what DOM is. And so I will record the session. I will. 

Not. Um, take care of styling just. Make a functional. Version of the game. With. Agreed of four by four elements. And. 

The. The. 

Elements. Get activated randomly in that grid. And the player needs to click on the activated element before that element is deactivated. 

Additionally the difficulty should increase with time. And. The the amount of activated elements should be recorded as well as the amount of successfully hit elements when. 

Let's say. Three elements are not hit in a timely fashion then the other game ends. 

During. 

Each activation the, Time of. Activation is reduced. To increase the difficulty of the game. 

The game should provide a start button. With a countdown of let's say three seconds before the the game actually starts. And that button should. Reappear after. The game ends.
