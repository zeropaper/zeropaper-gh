# Hello, my name's Vale

**TLDR; Internet technologies are shaping my career since the end of the 90's.**

I first spent 4 years learning technical drawing in order to become an architect. The profession was evolving and the first, fairly accessible, CAD softwares came on the market during that time. And while I learned a lot about planing, coordination, systems and construction, I also discovered computer graphics and created my first online portfolio of 3D works during these years.

It is during my media design studies I started in 2001 that my interest for interaction and visual creation has developed.  
Berlin seemed like a natural choice to immerge in a creative and technology friendly environment after I graduated from [EIKON](http://eikon.ch/).  

After more than 7 years of freelancing experience mostly building websites and portals using Drupal, [Camunda](https://camunda.com) convinced me to join their team of amazing developers. My work in this company has been varied, from setting up complex build system to the elaboration of a consistant design for the webapps, software development kit, widget library and websites of the company as well as end-to-end testing.

The surge to learn new technics and stay professionally fit led me to leave Camunda after 3 years. In a few month, I learned React and some of the newly added DOM features by creating an open-source, realtime audio analysis capable live-coding VJing software that runs in the browser and can be controlled by MIDI devices.

In 2017, an offer for a position of lecturer at Devugees picked my curiosity and I gave it a try. But I actually prefer to learn and create.

I began to work with the jobpal team in Novemeber 2018 and spend 2 years developing the interface which allowed to train and manage their chatbots, improving and maintaining the business part of their back-end.

Two years precisely after I joined the jobpal team, the company got acquired by [SmartRecruiters](https://smartrecruiters.com).
