# No Cookies

**TL;DR: don't sue me for visiting this web site or install it for offline usage**

This web site doesn't use cookie however you could not even access it if you had no connexions to Internet, if it wasn't hosted on a server somewhere or were not using a browser (ok, that last one is controvertial if you are an addept of `wget` or `curl`).  
These services may collect some information about the connection and its users.

On a side note, may use a "Service Worker" that the browser use to keep a copy of this page to work offline.

Additionally, this web site is a personal project without any kind of financial interests, it doesn't load files from any other domains and has no forms (beside maybe a search form that would probably also work in your browser only anyways).
