# Hello, my name's Vale

**Disclaimer:** This page is a work in progress.

Born in the french part of Switzerland. As I finished the mandatory school I spend 4 years learning technical drawing in order to become an architect.   
The profession was evolving and the first, fairly accessible, CAD softwares came on the market during that time. And while I learned a lot about planing, coordination, systems and construction, I also discovered computer graphics and created my first online portfolio of 3D works during these years.

It is during my media design studies I started in 2001 that my interest for interaction and visual creation has developed.  
Berlin seemed like a natural choice to immerge in a creative and technology enthusiastic environment after I graduated from [EIKON](http://eikon.ch/).

After more than 7 years of freelancing experience mostly building websites and portals, [Camunda](https://camunda.com) convinced me to join their team of amazing developers. My work in this company has been varied, from setting up complex build system to the elaboration of a consistant design for the webapps, software development kit, widget library and websites of the company as well as end-to-end testing.

The surge to learn new technics and stay professionally fit led me to leave Camunda after 3 years. Within a few month, I learned React and some of the newly added DOM features by creating an open-source, realtime audio analysis capable live-coding VJing software that runs in the browser and can be controlled by MIDI devices.

In 2017, an offer for a position of lecturer at Devugees picked my curiosity and I gave it a try. But realized that I actually prefer to learn, create and mentor when asked.

I began to work with the jobpal team in Novemeber 2018 and spend 2 years developing the interface which allowed to train and manage their chatbots, improving and maintaining most parts of the business back-end.

Two years precisely after I joined the jobpal team, the company got acquired by [SmartRecruiters](https://smartrecruiters.com) and I am now working on integrating the jobpal chatbot training user interface into SmartRecruiters. 

## Tech

In the early 2000's most of my code was **HTML** and **Flash**. As **XHTML** came out I embraced the seperation of concerns and dived deep in **CSS** and **JavaScript**.

It felt natural to start learning *functional programming* with **PHP** and **MySQL** and I gained some experience with **XML**, **RelaxNG** and **XSLT** as the first trainee [Liip (formerly Mediagonal)](https://liip.ch) ever had.

It is when I arrived in Berlin in 2005 that I learned to use **Subversion** (SVN), started creating websites, custom themes and modules for [**Drupal**](https://drupal.org) and involving myself in its developer community.

## Dream job

The best work environment I can think of would be a small, remote, team in which I would be asked for my opinion, technical expertise, my eye for aesthetic and capabilities in mentoring.

I especially enjoy

Tech advocate? Start-up Founder?

At least not at the end of the food chain.
